To create a cdk app run "cdk init app --language typescript"
Set your env, AWS_ACCOUNT_ID and AWS_REGION.
Run "cdk help" to see commands.
Run "cdk synth" to see cloudformation form.
### Option A — Configure a profile (recommended)
```bash
aws configure --profile my-cdk
# Enter Access key, Secret, and region (e.g., eu-west-2)

export AWS_PROFILE=my-cdk
aws sts get-caller-identity
cdk bootstrap
cdk synth
cdk deploy
```

### Option B — One-off via environment variables (inline)
```bash
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
- If your keys are temporary, also include `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...`. 
- Using a profile avoids retyping and is less error-prone.
```
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET \
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2 \
cdk bootstrap
